# cra-firebase-redux

Create React App starter template using Firebase Authentication and Real-time Database. I'm expecting to add Redux as a global state management system, but I'd like to see how far I can take this using the Context API before doing so.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Read below the horizontal rule for the Create React App general documentation.

## Firebase

In order to use Firebase, you'll need to set up an account [here](https://firebase.google.com/). Once you create an account, and set up a database, you'll need to copy the provided values in the Project Settings into an `.env` file in the `src/` directory. This should look like so:

```javascript
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=xyz123
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=xyz123
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=xyz123
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=xyz123
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=xyz123
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=xyz123
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
